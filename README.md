An example Model Context Protocol (MCP) server developed in Rust that demonstrates how to evaluate complex business rules using the ZEN Engine decision engine. This project serves as a reference implementation for building MCP servers with rule-based decision systems.

## ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**

**This is a demonstration/example project only.** The regulations, amounts, and evaluation logic implemented here are fictional and created solely for educational and demonstration purposes. This software:

- **Should NOT be used for actual legal or administrative decisions**
- **Does NOT represent real government regulations**
- **Is NOT affiliated with any official government entity**
- **Serves as a technical example of MCP server implementation**

For real legal advice or official information about leave assistance, please consult official government sources and qualified legal professionals.

## 🎯 Features

- **5 Example Evaluation Scenarios**: Demonstrates implementation of complex rule sets (A-E)
- **Decision Engine Integration**: Shows how to use ZEN Engine for rule-based evaluation
- **Multiple Transport Protocols**: Examples of STDIO, SSE, and HTTP streamable implementations
- **Robust Input Validation**: Demonstrates JSON schema validation with detailed error handling
- **Production-Ready Containerization**: Example Docker/Podman setup for deployment
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Example DXT packaging for MCP integration

## 📋 Example Assistance Scenarios (Fictional)

| Scenario | Description | Example Monthly Amount |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **A** | Care for first-degree relative (illness/accident) | 725€ |
| **B** | Third child or more with newborn | 500€ |
| **C** | Adoption or foster care | 500€ |
| **D** | Multiple birth, adoption, or foster care | 500€ |
| **E** | Single-parent families | 500€ |

> **Note**: These scenarios and amounts are completely fictional and used only for demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))
- Cargo (included with Rust)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alpha-hack-program/eligibility-engine-mcp-rs.git
cd eligibility-engine-mcp-rs

# Build all servers
make build-all

# Or build individually
make build-sse      # SSE Server
make build-mcp      # MCP HTTP Server
make build-stdio    # STDIO Server for Claude
```

### Running

```bash
# SSE Server (recommended for development)
make test-sse

# MCP HTTP Server
make test-mcp

# Or directly
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/sse_server
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Server configuration
HOST=127.0.0.1          # Bind address (0.0.0.0 for containers)
PORT=8001               # Server port
RUST_LOG=info           # Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)

# Or use BIND_ADDRESS directly
BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8001
```

### Example Usage

```json
{
  "input": {
    "relationship": "mother",
    "situation": "illness",
    "is_single_parent": false,
    "total_children_after": 2
  }
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "output": {
    "case": "A",
    "description": "Care for first-degree relative (illness or accident)",
    "monthly_benefit": 725,
    "potentially_eligible": true,
    "additional_requirements": "The person must have been hospitalized..."
  }
}
```

> **Important**: This is example data for demonstration purposes only.

## 🐳 Containerization

### Build and Run

This requires `podman` or `docker`. Adapt `.env` to your needs.

```bash
# Build container image
./image.sh build

# Run locally
./image.sh run

# Run from remote registry
./image.sh push
./image.sh run-remote
```

### Environment Variables for Containers

```bash
# Production configuration
docker run -p 8001:8001 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PORT=8001 \
  -e RUST_LOG=info \
  quay.io/atarazana/eligibility-engine-mcp-server:latest
```

## 📦 Claude Desktop Integration

### Packaging

```bash
# Create DXT package for Claude Desktop
make pack
```

### Example Claude Configuration

Drag and drop the `DXT` file into the `Settings->Extensions` dropping area.

> **Note**: This demonstrates MCP integration patterns and is not intended for production use with real data.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test
```

### Manual Testing Examples

Run the server: `make test-sse` or `./image.sh run`.

> This requires NodeJS 19+.

In another terminal.

```bash
make inspector
```

Then connect your browser to the suggest url given by the MCP inspector. Once there connect to `http://localhost:${PORT}/sse`

> `PORT` is set in `.env`

Connect and list tools, select the tool and use this JSON.

```json
{
    "relationship": "son",
    "situation": "birth",
    "is_single_parent": true
}
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Commands
